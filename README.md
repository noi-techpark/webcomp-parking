cd webcomp-parking/
```

### .env

npm run test
npm run lint
``` -->

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

## Docker environment

NOT IMPLEMENTED

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "yarn install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "yarn start"
