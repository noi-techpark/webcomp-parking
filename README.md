on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Node 14.15.4 / Yarn 1.22.10

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed
and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment)
section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:noi-techpark/webcomp-parking.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd webcomp-parking/
```

### .env

Create a `.env` file in the main directory.
Fill it with this content:

```
TILES_API_KEY=YourKey
```

Replace `YourKey` with your API token to use the tiles and the search bar.

### Dependencies

yarn start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

<!-- ## Tests and linting

The tests and the linting can be executed with the following commands:

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
``` -->

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Docker environment

NOT IMPLEMENTED

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "yarn install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "yarn start"
