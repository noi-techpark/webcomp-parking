## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Node 14.15.4 / NPM 8.1.2

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed
and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment)
section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:noi-techpark/webcomp-parking.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd webcomp-parking/
```

### .env

Create a `.env` file in the main directory.
Fill it with this content:

```
HEREMAP_API_KEY=YourKey
```

Replace `YourKey` with your API token to use the tiles and the search bar.

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Build and start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

<!-- ## Tests and linting

The tests and the linting can be executed with the following commands:

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
``` -->

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm build
```

## Docker environment

NOT IMPLEMENTED

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm run start"
```

### Documentation

More documentation can be found at [https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Boilerplate

The project uses this boilerplate: [https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-boilerplate](https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-boilerplate).

### License

The code in this project is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 license. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more information.

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
